# Piwik CampaignDetailed Plugin

## Description

CampaignDetailed is a Piwik plugin developed for tracking Adwords campaigns. 

Usage notes:

The plugin alters the Piwik database in order to be able to track the utm details passed by the Adwords campaign. To be able to use it, you need to update the database after install.

After installing, a menu item will be added on the sidebar and you can access your reports from there.  It includes a general overview page, where you some graphical reports are shown for all utm parameters. You can also select each parameter separately and access the specific reports aggregated for it. The plugin is based on the Piwik’s standards, so all functionalities available for a regular Piwik report are also available here. 

The plugin has it’s own segments that can be found under the ‘Adwords Analytics’ section.
